# port-scanner
User interface: MY code provides a clear screen at the beginning using subprocess.call('clear', shell=True), making the output more readable and organized.
Input handling: The original code uses raw_input to get user input, which is Python 2 syntax. In the second code, it should be updated to input for Python 3 compatibility.
Error handling: My code includes comprehensive error handling using try-except blocks. It catches exceptions like KeyboardInterrupt, socket.gaierror, and socket.error and provides appropriate error messages. This improves the reliability of the code and allows for graceful handling of exceptions.
Target information: My code prints a banner with information about the target being scanned, including its IP address. This provides useful context for the user.
Thread pool execution: My code utilizes the concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor class to execute the port scanning tasks concurrently in a thread pool. This allows for parallel execution of multiple tasks, potentially improving the scanning speed.
Range of ports: The original code scans all ports between 1 and 1024. In my code, the port range is adjustable by modifying the ports variable. This provides flexibility to scan a specific range of ports based on the requirements.
Completion message: My code includes a completion message that indicates the scanning process has finished. It adds a nice touch to the output and provides a clear indication that the scan is completed.
Overall, my code is an improvement over the original code as it introduces error handling, utilizes a thread pool for concurrent execution, provides a clear screen at the beginning, and includes additional information for the user. These enhancements enhance the functionality, reliability, and user experience of the port scanning script.
